## The next 3 are Road building options.

- Build-long-road-1-New
- Build-long-road-2-Connect
- Build-road-3-zigzag
- A typical road build goes like this. Hover mouse over a Road Flag, it has to be part of a road you have already built or the start flag of the Headquarters. Press one of the three road Hotkeys that you want to do, example build long road new. Then move mouse to what you want that road to end. hover mouse at destination and hit the Hotkey a second time. And there you have it, the full road with flags. A few experiments should get you going.
