## Overview
- I personally run the game as a Single Player. I've changed the options
- Toggle Building Spaces equals Notepad `*` , I toggle this on at the begining of the game and leave it on.
- Pause Game equals `space`. I set this to space as I was constantly pause unpausing the game and the pause button was in a very awkward possition.
- My code relies on `pause` as the pause button and I did not change that so unless you have modified the in game hotkeys for pause to something else all should be fine.
- I usually do mass building setup while the game is paused so I can take my sweet time. Hence in `Pause` I hover mouse over build site, hit F1 and the Quary is built there, the game unpauses and pauses again to show that the site is built.
## Potential issues.
- The Pause Unpause feedback is great for Single Players but I assume a pain in the ass for Multiplaying. So I suggest you disable the function
- unpause_pause(delay=0.2):
- Put return as the first line, this will disable the feature
- the delay is a feature , if the pause is too long, change the default to 0.1 or whatevers, but keep in mind that to short a time and it won't work as expected. Play with this setting if you wish for your optimum feedback.
